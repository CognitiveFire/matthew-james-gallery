# SendGrid Setup Guide

## Overview
The contact form is now integrated with SendGrid to send professional emails when customers submit inquiries. This guide will help you set up the necessary environment variables.

## Required Environment Variables

You need to set up the following environment variables in your Railway deployment:

### 1. SENDGRID_API_KEY
- **Purpose**: Your SendGrid API key for sending emails
- **Format**: Should start with "SG."
- **How to get it**:
  1. Log into your SendGrid account
  2. Go to Settings â†’ API Keys
  3. Create a new API key with "Full Access" permissions
  4. Copy the generated key

### 2. GALLERY_EMAIL
- **Purpose**: Email address where inquiries will be sent
- **Example**: `matthew@matthewjamesgallery.com`
- **Note**: This should be your main email address

### 3. FROM_EMAIL
- **Purpose**: Sender email address for automated emails
- **Example**: `noreply@matthewjamesgallery.com`
- **Note**: This should be a verified sender in SendGrid

## Setting Up Environment Variables in Railway

1. **Go to your Railway project dashboard**
2. **Click on your service**
3. **Go to the "Variables" tab**
4. **Add the following variables**:
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
   GALLERY_EMAIL=matthew@matthewjamesgallery.com
   FROM_EMAIL=noreply@matthewjamesgallery.com
   ```

## SendGrid Domain Verification (Recommended)

To ensure emails are delivered properly and don't go to spam:

1. **Verify your domain in SendGrid**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Sender Authentication
   - Add your domain (e.g., `matthewjamesgallery.com`)
   - Follow the DNS verification steps

2. **Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records** (optional but recommended for better deliverability)

## Testing the Contact Form

Once you've set up the environment variables:

1. **Deploy to Railway** (the environment variables will trigger a new deployment)
2. **Visit your contact page**
3. **Fill out and submit the form**

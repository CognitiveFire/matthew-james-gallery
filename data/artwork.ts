    title: 'The Listener',
    description: 'He\'s been listening for a while, though no one\'s quite sure to what. The Listener mixes bold colour and awkward confidence, with those oversized eyes taking everything in and giving nothing away. The rough brushwork and punchy coral tones make it both serious and a bit ridiculous, like someone who\'s just realised they might be in the wrong room but refuses to leave. It\'s modern, expressive, and quietly funny, a reminder that intensity and humour often share the same face.',
    shortDescription: 'He\'s been listening all day and still isn\'t sure what he\'s heard.',

    title: 'Winter Fox',
    description: 'Wrapped in her finest coat and sharper opinions, Winter Fox is an elegant older lady who enjoys a good walk, mostly so she can judge everyone she passes. Her oversized glasses and calm confidence say she\'s seen it all and probably didn\'t approve of most of it. Painted in cool blues and warm yellows, she\'s part fashion, part frost, and entirely unapologetic.',

    title: 'City Noise',
    description: 'A chaotic burst of colour and shape, City Noise feels like a night out that got out of hand but ended well. Every corner hums with energy, faces, lights, fragments of sound, all crammed together in unapologetic colour. It\'s loud, it\'s messy, and it\'s very much alive.',

    title: 'Still Waters Run Deep',
    description: 'Stillness in layers. Deep Water shifts between blue, green, and grey like memory itself, calm, but not quite settled. It\'s the quiet painting in a noisy room, the kind that rewards a longer look and a slower breath.',

    title: 'Social Listening',
    description: 'A Cold War scene reimagined for the age of gossip. Social Listening captures a group of men deep in discussion, unaware that someone is quietly listening from the balcony above. The flat colour blocks and sharp contrasts echo mid,century propaganda, while the story hides in plain sight, part espionage, part social commentary. It\'s the kind of painting where nothing happens, yet everything\'s being overheard.',

    title: 'The Dog Walker',
    description: 'He likes all things Americana, denim, diners, and cowboy boots. The Dog Walker is a portrait of a man who carries his Dobermann in a baby sling, and his head occasionally bursts into flames. It\'s playful, surreal, and oddly endearing. Like a roadside attraction you can\'t quite explain but definitely remember.',

    title: 'It Seemed Like a Nice Neighborhood to Have Bad Habits In',
    description: 'A late-night window, a crooked street, and someone thinking too much for their own good. It Seemed Like a Nice Neighborhood to Have Bad Habits In borrows its mood from old detective novels - the kind with cigarette smoke, quiet confessions, and no happy endings. The warm lights and heavy shadows make the scene feel both lonely and alive, like the story\'s still unfolding just out of frame.',

    title: 'It\'s Raining Again',
    description: 'It\'s Raining Again captures the quiet weight of another grey day. The figure\'s expression says everything, tired, thoughtful, and somewhere between acceptance and escape. The soft yellows and washed-out tones echo that peculiar Bergen light that makes everything feel both alive and half-asleep. There\'s humour in the endurance, and a kind of peace in the melancholy.',

    description: 'Set in Crete, The Mower shows a woman lost in the simple rhythm of cutting grass. The sun is bright, the air still, and the only sound is the hum of the mower, a small act of order in a wild landscape. There\'s no rush, no audience, just the calm satisfaction of cut grass and clear thoughts. It\'s a painting about zoning out, tuning in, and finding peace.',

It\'s organised mayhem, full of movement and noise, frozen into a pattern that somehow makes sense. The bold shapes and abstract forms echo the rhythm of water and the nervous energy of competition.',

    "artistStatement": "Artist Statement",
    "artistName": "Matthew James",
    "artistLocation": "English artist based in Bergen, Norway",
    "statement1": "Matthew James is an English artist based in Bergen, Norway. His work blends modern expressionism with a dry sense of humour, capturing the strange beauty of everyday life. Faces, cities, and fleeting moments appear in bold colour and loose form, always honest, sometimes ironic but never overthought.",
    "quote": "I paint because I have to. Most of the time I start without knowing how it will finish. The process decides the outcome, I just follow where the colour leads.",
    "statement2": "Each painting carries a touch of spontaneity and wit, often revealing its story only after it's finished. The result is a body of work that feels alive, human, and slightly unpredictable, much like the artist himself.",
    "processTitle": "The Process",
    "processSubtitle": "Spontaneous creation guided by intuition",
    "step1Title": "Start Without Knowing",
    "step1Text": "Each painting begins without a predetermined outcome, allowing the process to guide the creation.",
    "step2Title": "Follow the Colour",
    "step2Text": "Bold colours and loose forms emerge naturally, revealing the story as the painting develops.",
    "step3Title": "Reveal the Story",
    "step3Text": "The true meaning and narrative often becomes clear only after the work is complete.",
    "bergenTitle": "Inspired by Bergen",
    "bergen1": "Bergen, Norway serves as both home and muse for Matthew James. The city's dramatic landscapes, ever-changing weather, and vibrant cultural scene provide endless inspiration for his work.",
    "bergen2": "Much like his paintings, Bergen is alive, human, and slightly unpredictable, a perfect match for an artist who embraces spontaneity and follows where the colour leads.",
